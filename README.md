# Animated Glassmorphism Login Page

## Project Description
This project showcases my skills in **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **animation techniques** by creating a visually stunning and functional login page with a **glassmorphism effect**. The page features animated backgrounds, interactive elements, and a smooth user interface to provide a modern and dynamic user experience.

## Features
- **Glassmorphism Design**: A semi-transparent, frosted-glass aesthetic for the login container.
- **Animated Background**: Includes animated leaves and a moving character for a lively visual appeal.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for different screen sizes.
- **User Interaction**: Input fields with placeholder text, a login button, and links for "Forget Password" and "Signup."
- **CSS Animations**: Custom animations for background elements and a moving character.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Make sure all the assets (images and CSS) are in the same directory as the HTML file.

## Usage
1. Enter your username and password in the respective fields.
2. Click the **Login** button to simulate a login action.
3. Use the links to navigate to the "Forget Password" or "Signup" sections.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and the glassmorphism effect.
- **Keyframes**: Used for animating the moving character and falling leaves.

## Animation Details
- **Leaves**: Falling leaf animations are achieved using CSS keyframes. Each leaf moves in a unique path for a natural effect.
- **Character Animation**: The character moves across the screen and reverses direction seamlessly.
- **Transitions**: Smooth hover effects for buttons and links.
